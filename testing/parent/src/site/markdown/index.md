## wcm.io Testing

Helper tools for supporting Unit Tests, Integration test and test automation in AEM-based projects.

### Test mocks

*Quickstart for AEM applications*: [AEM Mocks Usage](aem-mock/usage.html) (which uses all the other mocks internally).

Mock implementations for running unit tests in AEM context without having to run a real AEM or Sling instance:

* [OSGi Mocks](osgi-mock/): Mock implementation of selected OSGi APIs.
* [JCR Mocks](jcr-mock/): Mock implementation of selected JCR APIs.
* [Sling Mocks](sling-mock/): Mock implementation of selected Sling APIs.
* [AEM Mocks](aem-mock/): Mock implementation of selected AEM APIs.

### Test helpers

Helper tools and extensions for testing:

* [JUnit Commons](junit-commons/): Common extensions of JUnit for supporting the wcm.io JUnit tests.
