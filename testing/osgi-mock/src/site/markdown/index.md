### Implemented mock features

The mock implementation supports:

* Instantiating OSGi `Bundle`, `BundleContext` and `ComponentContext` objects and navigate between them.
* Read and write properties on them.
* Register OSGi services and get references to service instances
* Service listener implementation
* When adding services to BundleContext OSGi metadata from `/OSGI-INF/<pid>.xml` is read (e.g. for service ranking property)
* Mock implementation of `LogService` which logs to SLF4J in JUnit context

The following features are *not supported*:

* Activation and deactivation methods of services are not called automatically
* No dependency injection takes place, the dependencies has to be set manually (e.g. via reflection)
